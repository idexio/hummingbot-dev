class SpreadsAdjustedOnVolatility(ScriptBase):
    """
    Demonstrates how to adjust bid and ask spreads based on price volatility.
    The volatility, in this example, is simply a price change compared to the previous cycle regardless of its
    direction, e.g. if price changes -3% (or 3%), the volatility is 3%.
    To update our pure market making spreads, we're gonna smooth out the volatility by averaging it over a short period
    (short_period), and we need a benchmark to compare its value against. In this example the benchmark is a median
    long period price volatility (you can also use a fixed number, e.g. 3% - if you expect this to be the norm for your
    market).
    For example, if our bid_spread and ask_spread are at 0.8%, and the median long term volatility is 1.5%.
    Recently the volatility jumps to 2.6% (on short term average), we're gonna adjust both our bid and ask spreads to
    1.9%  (the original spread - 0.8% plus the volatility delta - 1.1%). Then after a short while the volatility drops
    back to 1.5%, our spreads are now adjusted back to 0.8%.
